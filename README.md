NOTE: This repo was moved from the martinisgroup organization.
To tell git to pull updates from the new location, you'll
want to update the 'origin' remote in your local repository.
Use `git remote -v` to see the names and urls for all remotes
you have defined, then `git remote set-url` to update the url,
changing the organization to labrad:

```
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:martinisgroup/pylabrad (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:martinisgroup/pylabrad (push)

$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:labrad/pylabrad
```

Tips
----

Did you know about the LabRAD Node? It's super cool!
Start it easily with the labradnode.py script in the
scripts folder.
